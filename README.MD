# Egaru's adventure

**Find way out of scary dunjon by avoiding traps and finding exit doors**

HTML5 game I made back in 2016. It was build using [PhaserJS](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser).

Play it on [itch.io](https://e9aru.itch.io/egarus-adventure)

## Description
Help little Egaru to find way out of scary dunjon by avoiding traps and finding exit doors. Egaru's powers can help you in your adventure, he can clone himself and do slow motion.

It's pixelart style puzzle platformer with 15 quite challenging levels.
